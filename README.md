# Info / Requirements

This is a simple app to create a smart contract everytime a student completes a class.

As models, we have a teacher, students, courses, enrollments and completions with all associated scaffold to login as a teacher, already have students, course and enrollments loaded with seed.rb

Usage:
------
-login using "teacher@school.com" and "password"
-view courses and enrollment

What's left to do:
------------------
1-As a teacher, viewing the list of students for a particular course and student, I want to click on a button called "completed" which brings up a dialog box to add the mark (float), completed:true and date of completion. (Details in the Completion table). Using stimulus/hotwire.

2-When course is set to completed, a smart contart will be created and artifacts stored in the database (This is vague because I'm not sure how that works).

budget: to be discussed
time frame: one-week

That's it!

Please let me know if you have any questions or precisions needed.
