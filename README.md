# Requirements

This is a simple app to create a smart contract everytime a student completes a class.

As models, we have a teacher, student, and course with all associated scaffold to login as a teacher, already have students and course loaded with seed.rb

What's left to do:

1-As a teacher, viewing the list of students for a particular course, I want to create smart contract for student noting the course, mark and date completed.

2-When course is set to completed, a smart contart will be created and artifacts stored in the database (This is vague because I'm not sure how that works).

That's it!

Please let me know if you have any questions or precisions needed.
